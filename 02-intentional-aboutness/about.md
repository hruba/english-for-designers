## Katerina Hruba

Creative designer with sense of punctuality, and opened mind.

Passionate about all forms of art but mostly about design and photography. I think of myself as a positive and communicative person with a sense of empathy. I enjoy working in a team and I am always excited to learn new things. I am a hard worker and I donâ€™t like to do things at the last minute.
