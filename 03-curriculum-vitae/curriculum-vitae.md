# Kateřina Hrubá 

## Graphic designer 


I consider myself to be open-minded, creative, and with a sense of punctuality. I am passionate about all forms of art but mostly about design and photography. I think of myself as a positive and communicative person with a sense of empathy. I enjoy working in a team and I am always excited to learn new things. I am a hard worker and I don’t like to do things at the last minute.


I enjoy traveling and getting to know other cultures and people. During my high school studies, I traveled abroad twice for half a year. First, I spent six months in the US where I attended high school in Colorado. Then two years later, I visited Australia. Both experiences have brought me independence, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work in a multicultural setting. One of my other passions is swimming, so don't be surprised if you run into me with wet hair.

## Skills: 

I can work with most apps in the Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, XD, Lightroom, and Premier).

I try to look outside the box with every one of my projects and I think the key to a success in the field of graphic design is communication between the designer and the client.
