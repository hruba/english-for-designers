## VI

These days it's hard not to copy. We as designers are surrounded by all this great and creative work and we all want to do something similar. 

I remember when I started to do some designs I would always go to Pinterest or Instagram for inspiration and after I looked at these beautiful works and I felt the need to do it exactly the same otherwise, it won't be that good. So I tried to copy the work exactly the same but it did not look that good and I had a bad feeling that I did something wrong. So then I tried to change the design and eventually I liked it even better than the copied one. But I would never get what I wanted if I wouldn't first copy the original.



I think a good example of the impact of copying is baking. You can't really bake without a recipe and someone else had to write that recipe. You can alter the recipe for your own use but you will always copy it first. Even grand chefs started copying the delicious dishes from someone else and then altering it to their likes.
