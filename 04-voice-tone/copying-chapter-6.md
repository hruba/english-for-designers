## VI

These days it's hard not to copy. We as designers are surrounded by all this great and creative work and we all want to do something similar. 

I remember when I started to do some designs I would always go to Pinterest or Instagram for inspiration and after I looked at these beautiful works and I felt the need to do it exactly the same otherwise, it won't be that good. So I tried to copy the work exactly the same but it did not look that good and I had a bad feeling that I did something wrong. So then I tried to change the design and eventually I liked it even better than the copied one. But I would never get what I wanted if I wouldn't first copy the original.
