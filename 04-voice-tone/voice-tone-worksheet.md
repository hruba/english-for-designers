## Writing Style

Clear - The message of the article is very clear.

Useful - The article can be useful to many designers that are afraid of copying.

## Voice

1. Authentic - Telling stories about real-life events that happened.
2. Honest - True Facts. A lot of data.
3. Personal - Writing from an existing person's view.
4. Relatable - The author is himself from the key audience.
5. Inspirational - The main theme is to inspire someone.

## Tone

Matthew Str√∂m's tone is formal but not boring. He uses a lot of examples and quotations which makes him more believable. He also uses a lot of data that support his statements.  Also, his tone is very inspirational. I think the main theme of the article is to encourage people to not be afraid of copying. Matthew's writing is very honest and relatable mainly because he belongs to his key audience (designers).
