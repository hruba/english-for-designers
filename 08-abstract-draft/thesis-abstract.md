The topic of my bachelor's thesis is the brand identity of a newly created brand on the market based on real collaboration with the client. It is a very small startup Czech brand of luxurious gold jewelry called Michael Lada Jewelry started by a young goldsmith Michaela Antalov√°. The jewelry is handmade and can be worn on regular basis as well as on special occasions.

In the theoretical part, I describe and define the basic concepts that are related to brand identity and how important they are in the creation of corporate identity. At the same time, I define the jewelry market in the Czech Republic and I did a detailed analysis of Czech and foreign jewelry brands with similar merchandise.

In the practical part, I used the knowledge from the theoretical part and I describe in detail the creation of brand identity and design system for a specific brand Michael Lada Jewelry. I focused on logo design, design of printed materials, and web and social media design. Part of the practical part is a description of collaboration with the client.

The aim of my bachelor's thesis is to create a functional brand identity for a newly created jewelry brand on the Czech market so that it can be used in the future and increases awareness of the brand and the production of jewelry as such.
