Abstract
The topic of my bachelor's thesis is the corporate identity of a newly created brand on the market. It is a Czech brand of gold jewelry called Michael Lada Jewelry. The thesis is based on real cooperation with the client.

In the theoretical part I describe and define the basic concepts that are related to corporate identity and how important they are in the creation of corporate identity. At the same time, I define the jewelry market in the Czech Republic and I did a detailed analysis of Czech and foreign jewelry brands with a similar merchandise.

In the practical part I used the knowledge from the theoretical part and I describe in detail the creation of a corporate identity for a specific brand Michael Lada Jewelry. Part of the practical part is a description of cooperation with the client.

The aim of my bachelor's thesis is to create a functional corporate identity for a newly created jewelry brand on the Czech market, so that it can be used in the future and  increases awareness of the brand and the production of jewelry as such.
